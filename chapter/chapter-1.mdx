What is SPECKit Plus?

SPECKit Plus is a smart AI tool that helps you create software in a neat and organized way.

Instead of giving the AI random or confusing commands, you first write clear instructions about what you want to build. After that, the AI follows your instructions and creates the code step by step.

So, you are not just writing code.
You are planning first, then building.

This makes your work:

More clear

Less confusing

Less full of mistakes

It helps you think like a developer and planner, not just a person who types code.

How to Install It

Use this command to install SPECKit Plus:

npm install specifyplus

Main Parts of SPECKit Plus 
1. /constitution — Project Rules

Here you write the main rules for your project.
These rules do not change.

They tell the AI:

How the code should look

How data should be protected

What is allowed and what is not

You can think of it as the law book of your project.

2. /specify — Explain Your Idea

In this part, you clearly explain:

What you want to create

What it should do

How you will know it is working

It is like saying:

“This is the exact thing I want you to build.”

This becomes the basic design (blueprint) of your project.

3. /plan — Create the Roadmap

After you tell your idea, the tool makes a full plan for you.

This plan shows:

The main steps

The tools and parts needed

The order of work

It is basically a map of your whole project.

4. /tasks — Small Easy Steps

Now the big plan is divided into small, simple tasks.

For example:

Make a file

Write a small piece of code

Save information

Test if it works

This makes every step easy to follow and no work feels too big.

5. /implement — Start Building

In this final step, the AI starts working.

It:

Does one task

Finishes it

Moves to the next task

You can stop it, approve it, or ask it to fix something.
It keeps working until your project is fully complete.

This is the doing stage.
